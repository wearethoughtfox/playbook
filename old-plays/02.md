We must build digital services with an understanding of the range of ways a person might interact with our service, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on the phone, or in person. Every encounter should move the user closer towards the desired outcome, whether that encounter is online or offline.

#### checklist
1. Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service â€“ both online and in person
2. Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs
3. Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service
4. Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs, at each step of the service


#### key questions
- What are the different ways (both online and offline) that people currently accomplish the task the digital service is designed to help with?
- Where are user pain points in the current way people accomplish the task?
- Where does this specific project fit into the larger way people currently obtain the service being offered?
- What metrics will best indicate how well the service is working for its users?
