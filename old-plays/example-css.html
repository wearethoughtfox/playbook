        <h1>Retreat!</h1>

        <p>As 13 people working together in 11 different locations (in many cases separated by oceans and borders), it’s massively important for us to actively maintain our strong sense of culture and community. We <em>are</em> Fictive Kin after all.</p>

        <p>Our strongest tactic for this is our retreats. Two or three times a year we all come together for a week to talk, work and hang out. Predominantly featured are group outings, movie nights, card games, big breakfasts, vats of coffee, hangovers and beards. Here’s our place where we document them. Enjoy.</p>

        <h2><span>#6</span> Portland, January 2014</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="article">

        <p>Our first retreat of the year felt both celebratory and relaxing.  A number of us had spent significant portions of 2013 helping to transition some of our products into the wild with new teams, and this retreat marked everyone returning back to the Fictive Kin bosom, ready to take 2014 by storm.</p>

        <p>The chilled out Portland neighborhood inspired a similar vibe inside our Fictive Kin house; work, discussions, card games and hang outs all happened organically (we <em>were</em> in Portland, after all) and without a schedule.</p>

        <div class="image_row span2_5">

        </div>

        <p>Despite the mellow nature of the week, troublemakers Simon, Cameron and Tyler still managed to find some drama to involve themselves in. The story concludes with Simon having to save a guy from being hit by a suddenly-appearing ghost bus.</p> 

        <p>A roadtrip to Multnomah falls and Cannon Beach was enjoyed immensely, as were visits to some of Portland’s finest breweries. Apparently the “eating’s cheating“ mantra does not play well with the city’s renowned sour beers.</p>

        <h2><span>#5</span> Montreal, July 2013</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="article">

        <p>We enjoyed our 2012 retreat in Montreal so much we came back for a second summer of Canadian sunshine. This one felt a little more intense however; our ongoing experiment of how to sustain ourselves was one of the forefront discussions of the week.</p>

        <p>The work-focused atmosphere made the retreat feel fragmented, with small groups of folks breaking off to do their own thing, socially as well as work-wise.</p>

        <div class="image_row span2_5">

            <img src="images/retreat5_photo1.jpg" class="size_1_5">

        </div>

        <p>Still, the sheer volume of coffee consumed in the claustaphobic pool table room ensured that the week was productive. Skeletor, Grayskull, Happier and Plays (we love our codenames) all made progress and were presented to the group.</p>

        <p>Another sweaty, dusty game of football (soccer) was enjoyed, but only just, as the ball was nearly lost the previous evening when Tyler accidentally kicked it down a hill, towards a lake. The split-second decision to scramble after the ball was nearly a bad one; only a fortunately-positioned tree saved him from plunging into the lake. Classic save.</p>

        <h2><span>#4</span> The Peak District, January 2013</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="article">

        <p>Only a two-thirds-strong Fictive Kin made it to this one. Directly after <a href="http://newadventuresconf.com">New Adventures</a> (a conference that Colly and Greg organised, and Cameron and Tyler spoke at), we jumped in a couple of cars and drove from Nottingham up into the heart of one the UK’s finest national parks. Here we spent a week cooped up in a large converted barn.</p>

        <p>With an open fire surrounded by comfy sofas and a dining table suitable for 20, we relaxed and dined on a semi-nocturnal schedule. Work and talk sessions interspersed our days and nights; a hike up to Peter’s Stone and a trip to Manchester to watch a United game provided us with some much-needed some fresh air from time to time.</p>

        <div class="image_row span2_5">

            <img src="images/retreat4_photo1.jpg" class="size_1_5">

        </div>

        <p>Other highlights included the world’s largest fish &amp; chips order, Phil scaring the hell out of the North Americans as he got out his car to confront a police officer, and a group singalong session so epic in proportions that it took us well into the early hours and consumed every last drop in the barn.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="article">

        <p>Boy did we bring the weather for this one! The most beautiful sunny week of the year and we’re in town to catch it. Nice!</p>

        <p>We had three apartments that were pretty close to each other, the largest being our focal point for the week. A balcony at the front overlooking a park and a decking area out back made it a glorious place to hang and work. A dark room with a large TV made for some classic FIFA activity.</p>

        </div>

        <p>This retreat was a great one for getting caught up on team workflows and internal processes; CSS preprocessors, Javascript templating languages and virtual machines were all covered in detail.</p>

        <p>For the whole week we terrorised the streets of the city on Montreal’s public bicycles; what a sight we must have made. Poutine in the park, Fictive football (soccer), Evan’s Summer punch, and a mass appreciation for dragon bowls are all notable highlights. We rounded the week off with a day full of roller coasters and fireworks. Classy.</p>

        <h2><span>#2</span> NYC, March 2012</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="article">

        <p>Our first retreat as a larger, more official Fictive Kin. Before this point, we were more like a guerilla startup unit with separate teams working on separate things like Gimme Bar, Rushmore and Mapalong, amongst other things.</p>

        <p>We gathered in a couple of large, airy apartments in downtown Brooklyn and spent an intense initial few days talking about what this was all about. We talked about our ideas and our products and how to sustain ourselves with the kind of work we want to do. We also took walks around Brooklyn; to the promenade (via Shakeshack, of course), and around Boerum/Cobble hill areas.</p>

        <div class="image_row span2_5">
            <img src="images/retreat2_photo1.jpg" class="size_2_5">

            <img src="images/retreat2_photo3.jpg" class="size_1_5">
        </div>

        <p>The first night of the retreat saw five Fictives cramped in a tiny hotel room due to Tyler’s incredible ability to pass out as soon as his head hits the pillow. A fine skill in many circumstances, but maybe not when he’s carrying the only key to the apartment. Efforts to revive the sleeping Tyler included Simon throwing rocks at the apartment window, which resulted in him tripping over some trash bags backwards into the street. Simon got bruised, the rest of us laughed so much it hurt. Mission failed.</p>

        <h2><span>#1</span> Upstate NY, December 2011</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="article">

        <p>This was the first ever Fictive Kin retreat even though we weren’t quite Fictive Kin yet. We found an odd little cabin in Upstate New York, and when we arrived late at night, none of us were 100% convinced we’d survive the night. The art was unsettling, the whole place was bright green and there was a small door that led to a skinny hallway that led to a staircase that led to a secret sauna. There were bodies in the sauna.</p>

        <div class="image_row span2_5">
            <img src="images/retreat1_photo1.jpg" class="size_1_5">

            <img src="images/retreat1_photo3.jpg" class="size_1_5">   
        </div>

        <p>We took the weirdness into our stride, surviving the night, and had a great week. The place had a big kitchen and a huge, wood-burning, 360-degree fireplace with plenty of firewood.</p>

        <p>It was our first retreat and we tried to make it a little too much about work, which wasn’t a good idea. Retreats are about reminding everyone how nice it is to be around each other. The highlight was Tyler’s birthday; we all smoked cigars and played loud music, singing and dancing into the night. Ed participated remotely via Skype for the whole thing and won the “Best Dancer” award.</p>
