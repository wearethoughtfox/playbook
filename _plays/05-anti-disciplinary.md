The synthesis of disciplines
Science, art, engineering, design
The world is more complex and interesting - break out of the "tracks"

"Major innovation comes from the unexplored no-man's-land between the disciplines" - Norbert Weiner

"Creativity is just connecting things" - Without diverse experience, curiosity, synthesis - essentially, in a world made insular - the creativity and the functionality of the product will decline. http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html

Alex Coles - Transdisciplinary - not simply mixing disciplines but going beyond them. Break out of the tracks - the world is more complex and interesting. Science, art, engineering, design.
