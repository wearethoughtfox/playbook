title: Start with what people need
---
Begin by identifying and thinking about real user needs. These needs become the project's organising principal. What people do is more important than what they say. Solve real problems. Be a verb, not a noun.


### Checklist
1. Spend time with current and prospective users of the service
2. Use a range of qualitative and quantitative user research methods to determine people’s goals, needs and behaviors
3. Test prototypes of possible solutions with real people
4. Document and share the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
5. Create a prioritised list of user stories - short descriptions of the goals the user is trying to accomplish
7. Regularly test it with potential users to ensure it will meet peoples’ needs
8. Focus on useful everyday stuff used by all users

### Key questions
- What user needs will this service address?
- Why does the user want or need this service?
- Who are your key users?
- Which people will have the most difficulty with your service?
- How often are you testing with real people?
