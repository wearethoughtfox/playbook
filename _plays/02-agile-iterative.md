["Responding to change over following a plan."](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/)

Start with a discovery, try an alpha, and learn as we go. Iteration reduces risk by starting small, testing with real users and adding features and refinements as we go.
Make experimentation the rule, not the exception.
Get the validation needed to maximize the chances of creating something people want.

1. Discovery / Understand - Review background and user insights
2. Define / sketch - Brainstorm what’s possible
3. Decide / converge - Rank solutions, pick one
4. Build / Prototype - Create a Minimum Viable Concept
5. Test / Validate - Validate with users
... Iterate. Then iterate again

Show the thing - demo day - 5 mins to present, 5 mins for questions.

### Examples

#### Communications
micro-campaigns -> test various strategies -> see what works / what didn't -> tight feedback loops -> measure concrete results -> do more of what works

#### Product invention
* Consider: 1. The material, 2. Business needs, 3. People and the market
* Download - ideation / collect as many ideas as possible / if you say it, write it on a Post-It.
* Mapping the territory - cluster ideas / sketch / principles / shortlist of ideas
* Concepts to microbriefs (aim for three to six)

"A microbrief is how we encapsulate recommendations: it’s a sketch and short description of a new product or effort that will easily test out some hypothesis or concept arrived at in the workshop. It’s sketched enough that people outside the workshop can understand it. And it’s a hook to communicate the more abstract principles which have emerged in the days." - [Berg](http://berglondon.com/blog/2010/11/10/product-invention-workshops/)

### Checklist
1. Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need
2. Test frequently to see how well the service works for users and identify improvements that should be made
3. Keep teams small and focused
4. Release features and improvements often
5. [“Don't criticise without offering something better - the Ahtisaari Manoeuvre”](https://twitter.com/genmon/status/461930864948314112)

### Key questions
- How long in days are the iterations/sprints? Use timelines based on time not on calendars
- How often do you review and reprioritize the items in your feature and bug backlog?
- How do you collect user feedback during development and how is that feedback to improve the service?
- At each stage of usability testing, what gaps were identified in addressing user needs?
