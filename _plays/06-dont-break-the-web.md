title: Don't break the web
---
- baseline accessibility = “the minimum required technology to allow a user to accomplish the core task”

- Don't break the web / work with the web's grain - the possibilities and expectations of the medium

- Progressive enhancement / performance / future friendly

minimise dependencies and page weight

1. Split browsers into modern and old
2. Serve "core" content to everyone - all browsers, contexts, devices - as quickly as possible
3. Enhance with JavaScript
4. Device != context != network speed

Performance budget -


> Progressive enhancement. The indie web. Microformats 2. Responsive design. Adaptive content. Isomorphic or progressive javascript. These are all of a kind. They are a part of the art of developing for a fluid platform with wide-ranging capabilities—capabilities that can change on the same device from one extreme to another, within minutes, just by walking down into the basement seating area of your local coffee shop.
